RLBot supports <:python:601513253415288834> Python (most used), <:java:601511526167216129> Java, <:scratchcat:444921286703972352> Scratch, <:csharp:601512444396961796> C#, <:ferris:651069080278925312> Rust, <:cpp:601512590593490955> C++, <:js:601514078657183767> JavaScript, and <:golang:869121045792170046> Go. We recommend having some amount of experience with programming before making a bot. However, making a bot can be a great way to get more comfortable with programming or a specific language.\n\nYou can find example bots in each language on <http://www.rlbot.org/> showing off the basics and various features. We also have a few tutorials:\n- GoslingUtils (Python): <https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2MGDOTjPtl8fuoXmqxTmASW1ZtrPEXQ2>\n- VirxERLU (Python): <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeo0zkmzSE-UUFV-bd2vWtqiqe2cjaQNf>\n- RedUtils (C#): <https://youtu.be/zlXnX7snky8>\n- Java: <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0Chr9HhL2DQijgJ4b4ho4pBpxFfHXP0m>\n- Dodges (C#): <https://tangil.me/posts/dodges>\n- State systems (C#): <https://tangil.me/posts/state>\n- RLBotTraining: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGFmOZCpel8&list=PL6LKXu1RlPdxh9vxmG1y2sghQwK47_gCH>\n\nAddition resources, documentation, and examples can be found on the RLBot wiki at <https://github.com/RLBot/RLBot/wiki>.

            "A": "RLBot uses an API in Rocket League specifically made for us. This API is activated when the game is launched with the `-rlbot` flag, which simultaneously disables all online play. The RLBotCore dll communicates with the game through this API and this is where most of the magic happens. Communication with bots are done through sockets (shared memory in the past) which allow us to support a wide range of languages.",
